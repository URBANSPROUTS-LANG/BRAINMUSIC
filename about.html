  <h2>What is NeuroSound?</h2>
  <p>
    BrainMusic is a web-based audio session launcher designed to help you focus, relax, sleep, meditate, or study. 
    All audio sessions open in a new tab, ensuring uninterrupted playback. Think of it as a lightweight Brain.fm-inspired experience using Zoho-hosted audio files.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Home Page</strong> and choose your state: Focus, Relax, Sleep, Study, or Meditation.</li>
    <li>On the session page, click a track you want to play.</li>
    <li>The audio will open in a new tab — keep it running while you continue your work.</li>

  </ol>

  <h2>Tips for Best Experience</h2>
